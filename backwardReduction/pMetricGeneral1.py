# Optimized implementation of Backward Reduction
# Store the distances in a list of heaps
# Need to somehow store the indexes from the distances matrix in the same order as the heap, so that removing and changing distances matrix is easy
# Data structures to use - Priority queue? x

# use sorted list - make a list of pairs - (distance, index), and sort based on distances
# ignore a scenario when storing corresponding sorted list since the indexes are already part of the tuple
# put results in a file
