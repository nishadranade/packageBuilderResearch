run.py is a script in which the generator generates the desired number of scenarios and a distances matrix, and then applies 
backward reduction to reduce the number of scenarios by the desired number.

To run it, pass in the number of initial scenarios and scenarios to be eliminated as arguments 
For eg. python run.py 10 5
